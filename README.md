# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning project portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of applied ML projects I've developed to explore, implement, and evaluate algorithms across various domains including classification, clustering, and deep learning.

Each project is designed to highlight both practical implementation and theoretical understanding.

---

## Projects

| Project | Description | Techniques Used |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Breast Cancer Classification** | Distinguishes malignant vs benign tumors using clustering and supervised learning. | PCA, KMeans, SVC, ANN, Confusion Matrix |

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`
- `tensorflow`, `torch` (for deep learning projects)
- `Jupyter` or `.py` scripts for full reproducibility

---

## Goals

This portfolio demonstrates:
- Practical data preprocessing and model evaluation
- Comparison between unsupervised and supervised techniques
- Clean and readable code for educational and professional sharing
- Real-world datasets applied to ML fundamentals

## Getting Started

To run any project:

1. _Clone the repository_
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aidand13/aidan-ml-portfolio.git  
   cd aidan-ml-portfolio
   ```
2. _(Optional) Create a virtual environment_
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv  
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
3. _Install dependencies_
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
4. _Navigate to a project folder and run it_
  ```bash
  For Jupyter notebooks:  
  jupyter notebook
  
  For Python scripts:  
  python script_name.py
  ```
## About Me
I'm Aidan Drew, a _B.S. Applied Math & Computer Science_ graduate, and an incoming _M.S. Control Systems Engineering_ student. I am passionate about machine learning, data science, automation. and intelligent systems â€” especially where software meets the physical world. This portfolio reflects my hands-on experience with real-world data and model development.
